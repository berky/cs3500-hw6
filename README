CS 3500: Object-Oriented Design
Homework 6/Final Project: The Adventure Game

/**********************************

Adventure.scala:
        Added a few rooms, things, and people.

Cheat.scala:
        Want to know who is carrying what item? Use the verb "cheat"
        to find out.

Clock.scala:
        The interesting part of registering actions with the clock
        that have different priorities is that each action is added to
        a list in order of decreasing priority. That way, when it
        comes time to perform all the actions (when the clock ticks),
        we simply traverse the list as is and perform each action in
        order.

Computer.scala:
        Now shows my true feelings.

GPSTracker.scala:
        A usable device that reports the location of every person in
        the world. Iterate through the rooms in the world, and iterate
        through each room, pairing up people with their rooms in a
        master list. That sounds a lot more nefarious than it actually
        is. Used idiomatic code with regards to the overall project
        (casting, in particular) where possible. Borrowed main logic
        from Computer.scala. If the game becomes too difficult, it can
        extend Thing instead of MobileThing.

Grader.scala:
        An AutonomousPerson that is capable of turning
        CompletedHomeworks into GradedHomeworks, much like Jesus could
        turn water into wine, or so they say. Used idiomatic code with
        regards to the overall project (casting, in particular) where
        possible. Borrowed main logic from Computer.scala.

Laptop.scala:
        A Computer that extends MobileThing.

MaraudersMap.scala:
        "cheat" and GPSTracker all rolled into one...the final
        product, so to speak. Ideally we use this, since it can't be
        stolen by NPCs and destroyed, etc.

Person.scala:
        Changed everyone's initial health from 3 to 20 because I was
        tired of dying from troll bites.

Seppuku.scala:
        The verb "seppuku" provides a more...interesting way to end
        the game.

Wormhole.scala:
        The verb "wormhole" will send you to a random room on the
        map. Implemented in Person.scala, it's also registered as an
        automatic action every 10 clock ticks for every (N)PC.
